        <p>St Francis Xavier College is a 7–12 Catholic co-educational school in Victoria, Australia. In 2022, it has over 3,000 students and 300 teaching staff, with over 1,500 students and teachers in the Beaconsfield campus alone. It has campuses in Berwick, Beaconsfield and Officer.
            The Beaconsfield campus was opened on 7 February 1978, with an initial intake of 72 students, with the first principal being Robert Schneider.[2][6][7] Due to the increase demand for the Beaconsfield campus, the Cranbourne campus opened in 1987. However, seven years later the campus was converted into St. Peter's College.[5] The Berwick campus, opened in 2003, is a dedicated junior campus, serving students year 7 to 9, with the intention to serve the community of Berwick, and neighbouring communities like Narre Warren and Cranbourne.[3] The most recent campus to open is the Officer campus, which opened in 2012. Much like the Berwick campus it is for students between years 7–9. The Officer campus is meant to serve as the campus for students residing in Pakenham, Clyde, and outreaching suburbs of the Gippsland region.[4]
